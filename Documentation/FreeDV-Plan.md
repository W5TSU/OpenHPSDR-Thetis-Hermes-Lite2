# FreeDV-in-Thetis Project Plan (W5TSU)

## Goal

Native FreeDV digital voice support in the W5TSU Thetis build for the Hermes-Lite 2 —
starting with an RX-only 700E decode prototype to prove the wdsp insertion point, growing
toward a full FDV mode, with the neural RADE mode arriving later via upstream's C library
rather than our own port.

Development happens on the **`FreeDV` branch**. Status markers: ✅ done, ⬜ pending.

---

## Stage A — RX-only prototype (branch `FreeDV`)

### ✅ Phase 0 — codec2 toolchain *(done)*

- `.github/workflows/build-codec2.yml` dispatch workflow: MinGW64 build (codec2's CMake
  uses GCC-only flags, MSVC rejects it), `gendef` + `lib.exe` MSVC import library,
  `-static-libgcc` so the dll is self-contained (imports only KERNEL32/msvcrt)
- Vendored at `Project Files/lib/codec2_x64/`: `libcodec2.dll` (codec2 1.2.0, 121
  `freedv_*` exports), `codec2.lib`, public headers, LGPL-2.1 `COPYING`

### ✅ Phase 1 — wdsp DSP block *(done, CI green)*

- `wdsp/fdv.c` + `fdv.h`, modeled on the `rnnr.c` (NR3) block; sits **post-AGC** in the
  RXA chain (`RXA.c`, after the AGC meter)
- dsp_rate ↔ 8 kHz resampling via wdsp's `resampleF`, smoothed RMS gain to normalise
  wdsp's float levels into the modem's 16-bit domain, ring buffers bridging the dsp
  buffer size and `freedv_nin()`'s variable block size
- Passthrough-until-sync priming: raw modem audio stays audible for tuning; decode
  engages once synced and ~125 ms of output is buffered; underruns fall back gracefully
- Exports: `SetRXAFDVRun(channel, run)`, `GetRXAFDVSync(channel)`, `GetRXAFDVSnr(channel)`

### ✅ Phase 2 — console wiring *(done, CI green)*

- `dsp.cs`: P/Invoke declarations (rnnoise group pattern)
- `radio.cs`: `RXAFDVRun` cached property on `RadioDSPRX` (`RXANR3Run` pattern) — run
  flag survives wdsp channel rebuilds and applies via delayed update
- Setup → DSP → NR tab: "FreeDV (prototype)" group — **"Decode FreeDV 700E (RX1)"**
  checkbox (auto-persisted) + live sync/SNR label polled at 500 ms

### ⬜ Phase 3 — verification *(next; needs Windows + HL2)*

1. Bench: play a FreeDV 700E off-air recording through the Voicemeeter/VAC chain
   (mode DIGU, ~3 kHz filter) → expect decoded voice + green "SYNC SNR x.x dB"
2. Live: 14.236 MHz USB; check FreeDV Reporter (qso.freedv.org) for activity first
3. Iterate on findings: decoded speech level (`FDV_SPEECH_GAIN` in fdv.c), priming
   latency, DSP sample-rate-change robustness, CPU load

### ⬜ Phase 4 — prototype wrap-up

- Docs: FreeDV-native section in `Documentation/`, code_documentation regeneration
  (`fdv.c` needs a `CODE_OUTLINE.md` table row first), release-notes entry
- Decision gate: merge to master as an experimental feature in the next release,
  or keep maturing on the branch

## Stage B — Full FDV mode *(future, after the prototype proves out)*

- ⬜ TX path: mirror block in `TXA.c` using `freedv_tx()` — mic audio → 8 kHz →
  modem audio → SSB modulator
- ⬜ Mode selection: 1600 / 700D / 700E (`SetRXAFDVMode`), RX2/subRX support
- ⬜ 700D/E text messages: callsign beacon TX + received-text display
- ⬜ Real UI: console mode button or info-bar sync light; entering FDV auto-applies the
  no-speech-processing TX rules (see `Documentation/Thetis_VB-Audio_config.md` §7)
- ⬜ Possible `DSPMode.FDV` enum member — the high-merge-cost step; only if Stage B
  ships for real
- ⬜ CAT/TCI exposure of FDV state

## Stage C — RADE neural mode *(external dependency)*

- ⬜ Watch upstream: David Rowe's RADE V2 C port is in progress (classical DSP ported
  as of May 2026; C library distribution planned after their stored-file test campaign
  validates the algorithms — see freedv.org)
- ⬜ When the C library ships: build it with a `build-codec2.yml`-style workflow and
  slot it into `fdv.c`'s mode handle — a dependency bump, not a research project
- Re-coding RADE ourselves was evaluated and rejected: months of duplicated effort and
  a validation problem only upstream's test campaign can solve

## Standing constraints

- Everything new lives in new files; hooks into shared files are single-line and
  `// W5TSU`-tagged (upstream merge survival — see `Project Files/Source/AGENTS.md`)
- Older Console files can have mixed CRLF/LF line endings (`radio.cs`) — check diff
  size after editing; rebuild byte-exact if an editor flattens them
- Windows-only build: CI (`gh workflow run build.yml --ref FreeDV -R
  W5TSU/OpenHPSDR-Thetis-Hermes-Lite2`) verifies compile; behavior is verified on-air
- codec2 is LGPL-2.1, dynamically linked; its license ships beside the dll
